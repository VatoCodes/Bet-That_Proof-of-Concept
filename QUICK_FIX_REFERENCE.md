# Quick Fix Reference - Edge Display Issues
**What Was Wrong & How It Was Fixed**

---

## The Problem (One Sentence)

Frontend JavaScript wasn't extracting the `edges` array from the API response object AND Dashboard was missing the required `week` parameter.

---

## The Fix (30 Seconds)

### Edges Page (`dashboard/templates/edges.html`)
```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Line 740):
this.edges = await response.json();

// ‚úÖ AFTER:
const data = await response.json();
this.edges = data.edges;
```

### Dashboard Page (`dashboard/templates/index.html`)
```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Line 452):
fetch('/api/edges?min_edge=0.05')

// ‚úÖ AFTER:
fetch(`/api/edges?week=${this.currentWeek}&min_edge=0.05&strategy=all`)
```

---

## Test It (10 Seconds)

```bash
# Open in browser:
http://localhost:5001/          # Dashboard (should show 1 edge)
http://localhost:5001/edges     # Edges page (should show 1 card)

# Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
```

---

## Why It Happened

**Backend changed, frontend didn't.**

Old backend returned:
```javascript
[{edge_percentage: 18.5, qb_name: "..."}]  // Direct array
```

New backend (Strategy Aggregator) returns:
```javascript
{success: true, edges: [{edge_pct: 18.5, matchup: "..."}]}  // Wrapped object
```

Frontend was still expecting the old format.

---

## Files Changed

1. ‚úÖ `dashboard/templates/edges.html` (4 changes)
2. ‚úÖ `dashboard/templates/index.html` (5 changes)

Backend files: **No changes needed** - was already working!

---

## Quick Diagnosis (If It Breaks Again)

### Symptoms:
- Shows "0 opportunities" or "No edges found"
- Console error: `edges.reduce is not a function` or `Cannot read property 'forEach'`

### Check:
```bash
# 1. Test API directly
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/edges?week=7&strategy=all&min_edge=0"

# 2. Check console (F12)
# Should see: "‚úÖ Loaded X edges" or "‚úÖ Dashboard loaded X edges"

# 3. If API returns data but page doesn't show it:
# ‚Üí Response extraction bug (not getting data.edges)

# 4. If API returns error:
# ‚Üí Missing week parameter or invalid week
```

---

## Summary

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| API response not extracted | `edges.html:740` | `data.edges` instead of entire response |
| Wrong field names | `edges.html:838,845,784` | `edge_pct` instead of `edge_percentage` |
| Missing week param | `index.html:452` | Add `week=${this.currentWeek}` |
| No currentWeek variable | `index.html:409` | Add `currentWeek: {{ current_week }}` |
| Table field mismatch | `index.html:327` | Rewrite table for simplified format |

---

## What to Remember

**Golden Rule:** When backend API changes format, update frontend to match.

**Debug Flow:**
1. Test API with curl ‚Üí If works, issue is frontend
2. Check browser console ‚Üí Shows exact error
3. Check Network tab ‚Üí Shows actual API response
4. Fix data extraction ‚Üí Match response structure
5. Fix field names ‚Üí Match response fields

## Done! üéØ

Both pages now work. Check them at:
- http://localhost:5001/ (Dashboard)
- http://localhost:5001/edges (Edges page)
