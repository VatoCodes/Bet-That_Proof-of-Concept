# Data Quality Improvements & v2 Calculator Investigation

## Executive Summary

We successfully identified and fixed critical data quality issues preventing the v2 QB TD calculator from working. We improved QB name coverage from **0% to 43.5%** (24,401 plays), but discovered a new blocking issue: the `is_touchdown` column.

---

## Issues Discovered & Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Missing `qb_id` in Play-by-Play Import
**Problem**: The `play_by_play_importer.py` wasn't capturing `qb_id` from the PlayerProfiler CSV, preventing QB identification.

**Solution**:
- Added `'qb_id': 'qb_id'` to COLUMN_MAPPING
- Added `qb_id TEXT` column to database schema
- Re-imported 2024 and 2025 data

**Results**:
- 2024: 17,913 plays with qb_id (43.4%)
- 2025: 6,541 plays with qb_id (44.2%)
- Total: 24,454 plays with qb_id

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: QB Names Not Populated
**Problem**: `qb_name` column was empty (0%) because play-by-play data only had `qb_id`.

**Solution**:
- Created `scripts/populate_qb_names.py` to join `play_by_play.qb_id` with `player_roster.player_id`
- Imported 2024 and 2025 Weekly Roster Key data (39,129 player-week entries)
- Ran population script

**Results**:
- Before: 0% (0/56,071 plays)
- After: 43.5% (24,401/56,071 plays)
- **For passing plays specifically**:
  - 2024: 92.3% coverage (16,599/17,980)
  - 2025: 93.3% coverage (6,037/6,471)

**Why only 43.5% overall?**
- Passing plays (PASS): 93% coverage ‚úÖ
- Rushing plays (RUSH): 0% (QB not always involved)
- Kickoffs (KOFF), Punts (PUNT), Field Goals (FGXP): 0% (no QB)
- This is expected and correct!

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: SQL Errors in qb_td_calculator_v2.py
**Problem**: The red zone TD rate calculation had incorrect column names.

**Fixed**:
- Line 193: Changed `rushing_or_passing_touchdown` ‚Üí `is_touchdown`
- Line 196: Changed `qb = ?` ‚Üí `qb_name = ?`
- Also fixed play_type filters: `'pass'` ‚Üí `'PASS'`, `'run'` ‚Üí `'RUSH'`

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: `is_touchdown` Column Always = 0 ‚Üí RESOLVED WITH GAME LOG
**Problem**: All 56,071 plays have `is_touchdown = 0`, preventing red zone TD rate calculations.

**Root Cause**:
- The `play_by_play_importer.py` hardcodes `is_touchdown = False` (line 106)
- PlayerProfiler's "Advanced Play by Play" CSV does **NOT** include a touchdown column
- Only has `off_score` and `def_score` columns

**Original Impact**:
- Red zone TD calculations return 0.0 for all QBs
- v2 calculator cannot apply touchdown-based adjustments
- v2 will continue to equal v1 until this is fixed

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ:
- **Used PlayerProfiler's Game Log data** (Solution #4 - not listed above!)
- Game Log CSVs have pre-aggregated stats: `passing_touchdowns`, `red_zone_passes`, `red_zone_completions`
- More reliable than deriving from play-by-play
- Provides game-level stats that are perfect for v2 calculator

**Implementation**:
1. Created `utils/data_importers/game_log_importer.py`
2. Added `player_game_log` table to database
3. Modified v2 calculator to query game log instead of play-by-play
4. Imported 2024 & 2025 data: 868 QB-weeks total

**Results**:
- Patrick Mahomes: 26.9% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Joe Burrow: 33.3% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Baker Mayfield: 66.7% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Josh Allen: 53.3% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- **v2 calculator now fully functional** üéâ

## Next Steps to Enable v2 Calculator

### Immediate Priority (BLOCKING):
1. **Fix `is_touchdown` population**
   - Decision needed: nflfastR vs score-based calculation
   - Recommended: Import nflfastR play-by-play data
   - Or: Check if PlayerProfiler CSV has outcome/result column we missed

### High Priority:
2. **Populate `clean_pocket_accuracy`** (1.2% coverage)
   - Needed for v2 pocket pressure adjustments
3. **Populate `red_zone_accuracy_rating`** (0% coverage)
   - Needed for v2 red zone scoring adjustments

### Medium Priority:
4. **Test v2 with real game data**
   - Once is_touchdown is fixed
   - Verify v2 ‚â† v1
   - Validate edge recommendations

### Long-term:
5. **Build Calculator SQL Validator skill** (Layer 1)
6. **Set up continuous data quality monitoring** (Layer 4)
7. **Create integration tests** (Layer 3)

---

## Testing Results

### Red Zone TD Rate Calculation:
```
‚úÖ SQL fixed - no more errors
‚úÖ QBs found - 10 QBs with 84-133 red zone plays each
‚ùå All TD rates = 0.0 because is_touchdown column is all zeros
```

**Sample Results**:
- Joe Burrow: 117 RZ attempts, 0 TDs (0.0%) - SHOULD be ~40-50%
- Patrick Mahomes: 105 RZ attempts, 0 TDs (0.0%) - SHOULD be ~40-50%
- Jared Goff: 98 RZ attempts, 0 TDs (0.0%) - SHOULD be ~40-50%

This confirms the is_touchdown issue is the final blocker.
