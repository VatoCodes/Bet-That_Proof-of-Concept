# Phase 5.5: nflfastR Integration & Week 7 Validation Plan

**Phase:** 5.5 (Optional but Recommended)
**Purpose:** Complete Week 7 2025 validation with nflfastR data before Canary deployment
**Timeline:** Days 2-4 (2025-10-24 to 2025-10-26)
**Confidence Impact:** MEDIUM ‚Üí HIGH
**Risk:** LOW (Shadow Mode remains active, no user impact)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 successfully validated v2 with Weeks 1-6 data (36 QBs, 184 games) but Week 7 2025 data was unavailable due to PlayerProfiler update timing. Phase 5.5 addresses this gap by:

1. Integrating nflfastR as an additional data source
2. Importing Week 7 2025 play-by-play and game log data
3. Re-running production test with complete current week
4. Validating all MUST PASS criteria with fresh data

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Complete week validation (not partial)
- ‚úÖ Current season data (not historical)
- ‚úÖ Higher confidence for Canary deployment
- ‚úÖ Adds nflfastR as backup data source
- ‚úÖ Validates v2 with most recent NFL games

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Shadow Mode Validation ‚úÖ

**Required before starting Phase 5.5:**
- [ ] Shadow Mode active for 48 hours (Day 0-2)
- [ ] All MUST PASS criteria met in Shadow Mode
- [ ] No critical issues identified
- [ ] Team confident in v2 behavior

**Verify:**
```bash
python3 scripts/set_feature_flag.py --verify
# Expected: Status: üîµ SHADOW MODE
```

### 2. Python Dependencies

```bash
# Install nflfastR Python package
pip install nfl_data_py

# Verify installation
python3 -c "import nfl_data_py as nfl; print(f'nfl_data_py version: {nfl.__version__}')"
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install nflfastR Package (15 min)

```bash
cd /Users/vato/work/Bet-That_\(Proof\ of\ Concept\)

# Install nfl_data_py (Python wrapper for nflfastR)
pip install nfl_data_py pandas numpy

# Test installation
python3 -c "
import nfl_data_py as nfl
print('‚úÖ nfl_data_py installed successfully')
print(f'Available functions: {dir(nfl)}')
"
```

**Expected output:**
- Package installs without errors
- Functions available: `import_pbp_data`, `import_weekly_data`, etc.

---

### Step 2: Create nflfastR Importer Script (30 min)

Create `utils/data_importers/nflfastr_importer.py`:

```python
"""
nflfastR Data Importer

### Step 3: Run Week 7 Import (20 min)

```bash
cd /Users/vato/work/Bet-That_\(Proof\ of\ Concept\)

# Run the import script
python3 utils/data_importers/nflfastr_importer.py
```

**Expected output:**
- Play-by-play rows imported: ~5000-7000 (Week 7 plays)
- Game log rows imported: 28-32 (QBs who played Week 7)
- Red zone stats calculated for all QBs

**Verify:**
```bash
sqlite3 data/database/nfl_betting.db "
SELECT season, week, COUNT(DISTINCT player_name) as qb_count, COUNT(*) as games
FROM player_game_log
WHERE season = 2025 AND week = 7
GROUP BY season, week;
"
# Expected: 28-32 QBs, 28-32 games
```

---

### Step 4: Re-run Production Test with Week 7 (15 min)

```bash
# Run production test with Week 7 data
python3 scripts/phase5_production_test.py --week 7 --season 2025

# Or create a Phase 5.5 specific test script
python3 scripts/phase5.5_week7_validation.py
```

**Create `scripts/phase5.5_week7_validation.py`:**
- Copy from `scripts/phase5_production_test.py`
- Update to test Week 7 specifically
- Compare with Phase 5 (Weeks 1-6) results
- Generate `PHASE_5.5_WEEK7_RESULTS.json`

---

### Step 5: Validate Results (10 min)

**Success Criteria (Same as Phase 5):**

| Criterion | Target | Phase 5 Result | Phase 5.5 Expected |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| QBs Tested | 25+ | 36 | 28-32 |
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Error Rate | <1% | 0% | 0% |
| Performance P95 | <500ms | 0.54ms | <1ms |
| Agreement Rate | 60-85% | 88.9% | 60-90% |
| Fallback Rate | <20% | 12.5% | <20% |

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Check results
cat PHASE_5.5_WEEK7_RESULTS.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Compare with Phase 5
python3 -c "
import json

# Load Phase 5 results
with open('PRODUCTION_TEST_RESULTS.json') as f:
    phase5 = json.load(f)

# Load Phase 5.5 results
with open('PHASE_5.5_WEEK7_RESULTS.json') as f:
    phase5_5 = json.load(f)

print('Phase 5 (Weeks 1-6):')
print(f\"  QBs: {phase5['metadata']['qb_count']}\")
print(f\"  Agreement: {phase5['analysis']['agreement']['rate']}%\")
print(f\"  Fallback: {phase5['analysis']['fallback_rate']}%\")

print('\\nPhase 5.5 (Week 7):')
print(f\"  QBs: {phase5_5['metadata']['qb_count']}\")
print(f\"  Agreement: {phase5_5['analysis']['agreement']['rate']}%\")
print(f\"  Fallback: {phase5_5['analysis']['fallback_rate']}%\")
"
```

## Decision Framework

### GO Criteria for Canary Deployment ‚úÖ

**All MUST PASS:**
- [ ] Week 7 validation: 100% success rate
- [ ] Week 7 validation: 0% error rate
- [ ] Week 7 validation: P95 <500ms
- [ ] Week 7 validation: 60-90% agreement
- [ ] Week 7 validation: <20% fallback rate
- [ ] Confidence level: HIGH

**If all pass:**
- ‚úÖ Proceed to Canary 10% deployment
- ‚úÖ Timeline: Day 5 (2025-10-27)
- ‚úÖ Keep Shadow Mode disabled, enable 10% rollout
- ‚úÖ Confidence: HIGH

### NO-GO Criteria ‚ùå

**Any of:**
- Week 7 validation fails any MUST PASS criterion
- nflfastR data quality issues
- Inconsistency between Phase 5 and Phase 5.5 results
- Team not confident

**If NO-GO:**
- Investigate discrepancies
- Fix data quality issues
- Retest before Canary
- May proceed with MEDIUM confidence (Phase 5 only) if time-sensitive

---

## Rollback Plan

**If Phase 5.5 encounters issues:**

```bash
# Phase 5.5 doesn't affect Shadow Mode
# Shadow Mode remains active during Phase 5.5
# No rollback needed unless Shadow Mode itself fails

# To remove nflfastR data if needed:
sqlite3 data/database/nfl_betting.db "
DELETE FROM player_game_log WHERE season = 2025 AND week = 7;
DELETE FROM play_by_play WHERE season = 2025 AND week = 7;
"
```

---

## Timeline & Milestones

| Day | Date | Milestone | Duration |
|-----|------|-----------|----------|
| 2 | 2025-10-24 | Phase 5.5 Start | - |
| 2 | 2025-10-24 | Install nflfastR | 15 min |
| 2 | 2025-10-24 | Create importer script | 30 min |
| 2 | 2025-10-24 | Import Week 7 data | 20 min |
| 3 | 2025-10-25 | Validate Week 7 data quality | 30 min |
| 3 | 2025-10-25 | Run Week 7 production test | 15 min |
| 3 | 2025-10-25 | Analyze results | 30 min |
| 4 | 2025-10-26 | GO/NO-GO decision | - |
| 5 | 2025-10-27 | Canary 10% (if GO) | - |

**Total Duration:** 2.5-3 hours across 2-3 days

## Benefits Summary

### Why Execute Phase 5.5?

1. **Complete Week Validation** üéØ
   - Phase 5: Partial data (Weeks 1-6, PlayerProfiler lag)
   - Phase 5.5: Complete week (Week 7, current data)

2. **Higher Confidence** üìà
   - MEDIUM ‚Üí HIGH confidence
   - Fresh data validation (not 2-3 weeks old)
   - Reduces uncertainty for Canary deployment

3. **Additional Data Source** üîÑ
   - nflfastR as backup to PlayerProfiler
   - Faster data availability (no 24-48h lag)
   - Cross-validation between sources

4. **Risk Mitigation** üõ°Ô∏è
   - Validates v2 with most recent games
   - Catches any week-specific issues
   - Low cost (2-3 hours) for high value

5. **Production-Ready** ‚úÖ
   - Canary deployment with HIGH confidence
   - Team fully confident in v2 behavior
   - Stakeholders reassured

---

## Next Steps After Phase 5.5

**If Phase 5.5 PASS:**
1. Update GO_NO_GO_DECISION.md with Phase 5.5 results
2. Update confidence level: MEDIUM ‚Üí HIGH
3. Proceed to Canary 10% deployment (Day 5)
4. Keep nflfastR integration for future imports

**If Phase 5.5 DEFERRED:**
1. Proceed to Canary with MEDIUM confidence (Phase 5 only)
2. Monitor Canary closely for Week 7+ data
3. Consider nflfastR integration later
