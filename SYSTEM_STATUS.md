## 📅 Automated Schedule

**TWICE-DAILY Scraping**: Monday through Saturday (12 runs/week total)

### Morning Run (9:00 AM) - Full Scrape
**Collects:** ALL data
- Defense stats
- QB stats
- Matchups
- Odds (spreads, totals, QB TD props)

### Afternoon Run (3:00 PM) - Odds Only
**Collects:** ODDS data only
- Spreads
- Totals
- QB TD props

**Why Twice Daily?**
- **Morning (9am)**: Baseline data capture
  - Monday: First scrape after weekend games
  - Tuesday: Stats after Monday Night Football
  - Opening lines for all markets

- **Afternoon (3pm)**: Line movement tracking
  - Track how odds shift throughout the day
  - More player props available (often post mid-day)
  - Pre-game final check (Saturday 3pm before evening games)

**Benefits:**
- 2 snapshots/day = excellent line movement data
- Catch player props whenever they post
- 12 total data points per week (vs 6 with single daily)

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

### Current Setup
```
Free Tier:  6 keys × 500 requests  = 3,000 requests/month
Paid Tier:  1 key  × 20,000 requests = 20,000 requests/month
Total:      7 keys                  = 23,000 requests/month
```

### Smart Key Usage
- **Free keys**: Used first for spreads & totals
- **Paid key**: ALWAYS used for QB TD player props
- **Fallback**: Paid key used if free keys exhausted

### Usage Pattern
```
Per Run:        ~19 requests
Runs per day:   2 (9am + 3pm)
Per Day:        ~38 requests
Per Week:       ~228 requests (6 days × 2 runs)
Per Month:      ~980 requests
Capacity:       23,000 requests/month
Utilization:    ~4.3% (still massive headroom - 95.7% available)
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### Week Management First
```bash
# ALWAYS check current week before scraping
python utils/week_manager.py

# Set to current NFL week if needed
python utils/week_manager.py --set-week 8 --status in_progress

# Validate data files for current week
python utils/week_manager.py --validate
```

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test both schedulers immediately
python scheduler.py --test         # Morning run (all data)
python scheduler_odds.py --test    # Afternoon run (odds only)

# Test specific components
python main.py --week 7              # Full pipeline
python main.py --stats-only          # Just stats
python main.py --odds-only           # Just odds
```

### Production Use
```bash
# Start BOTH schedulers (run in separate terminals or background)
python scheduler.py          # Terminal 1: 9am runs
python scheduler_odds.py     # Terminal 2: 3pm runs

# Run both in background (macOS/Linux)
nohup python scheduler.py > scheduler_main.log 2>&1 &
nohup python scheduler_odds.py > scheduler_odds_output.log 2>&1 &
```

### Check Status
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f scraper.log          # Pipeline execution
tail -f scheduler.log        # Main scheduler (9am)
tail -f scheduler_odds.log   # Odds scheduler (3pm)

# Check API usage
python -c "
from scrapers.odds_scraper import OddsScraper
s = OddsScraper()
print(s.get_usage_report())
"

# Verify output files (both AM and PM runs)
ls -lh data/raw/
head data/raw/odds_spreads_week_7.csv        # 9am data
head data/raw/odds_spreads_week_7_3pm.csv    # 3pm data
```

## 🎓 Learning the System

### For New Users

1. **Start with README.md**
   - Understand what the system does
   - Follow quick start guide
   - Run manual tests

2. **Read ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - See how components work together
   - Understand data flow
   - Learn error handling

3. **Check Specialized Guides**
   - `COMPLETE_ODDS_DATA_GUIDE.md` for odds details
   - `PAID_API_SETUP.md` for API configuration
   - `QB_TD_PROPS_SETUP.md` for player props specifics

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Test individual scrapers
   python scrapers/defense_stats_scraper.py 7
   python scrapers/odds_scraper.py 7

   # Test full pipeline
   python main.py --week 7

   # Test scheduler
   python scheduler.py --test
   ```

### For Developers

**Modifying Scrapers:**
1. Read the pseudocode in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Understand error handling patterns
3. Test changes with individual scraper runs
4. Verify with full pipeline test

**Adding New Markets:**
1. Check The Odds API docs for market names
2. Add market to `odds_scraper.py`
3. Create parsing function (follow existing patterns)
4. Update `fetch_all_odds()` to include new market
5. Test and verify output CSV

**Changing Schedule:**
1. Edit `SCRAPE_DAYS` and `SCRAPE_TIME` in `config.py`
2. Restart scheduler
3. Verify with `python scheduler.py` (check logged schedule)

## ✨ Key Features Explained

### 1. Duplicate Column Handling
**Problem**: Pro Football Reference has multiple "TD" columns
**Solution**: Rename duplicates before processing
```python
# defense_stats_scraper.py line ~80
# Renames to: TD, TD_1, TD_2, etc.
```

### 2. Per-Event Player Props Fetching
**Problem**: Player props not available via general `/odds` endpoint
**Solution**: Two-step process
1. GET `/events` to list all games
2. GET `/events/{id}/odds` for each game individually

### 3. Smart API Key Rotation
**Problem**: Need to conserve paid key for player props
**Solution**: Three-tier strategy
1. Free keys used first (for spreads/totals)
2. Paid key ALWAYS used for player props
3. Automatic fallback if free keys exhausted

### 4. Daily Scheduling
**Problem**: Player props post at different times
**Solution**: Daily scraping Tue-Sat captures data whenever available
