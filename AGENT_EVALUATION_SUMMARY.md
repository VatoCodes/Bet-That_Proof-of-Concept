# Agent & Skill Evaluation Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Context:** Post-Game Log Integration - Dual-Source Architecture (Play-by-Play + Game Log)

## Executive Summary

Successfully integrated Game Log data to fix the `is_touchdown=0` blocker in v2 calculator. All agents have been evaluated for compatibility with the new dual-source architecture where:
- **Play-by-Play**: Provides play-level context (down, distance, field position)
- **Game Log**: Provides pre-aggregated stats (touchdowns, red zone attempts)

## üìä Data Import Agents

### 1. `game_log_importer.py` ‚ú® NEW
**Location:** [utils/data_importers/game_log_importer.py](utils/data_importers/game_log_importer.py)
**Purpose:** Import QB game-by-game statistics from PlayerProfiler

**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Features:**
- Imports passing TDs, red zone passes, deep ball attempts
- Handles 2020-2025 seasons (868 QB-weeks imported)
- Validates data quality (min weeks, min attempts)
- Creates historical snapshots

**Database Impact:**
- New table: `player_game_log`
- Indexes on: `(player_name, season, week)`

---

### 2. `playerprofile_importer.py` ‚úÖ UPDATED
**Location:** [utils/data_importers/playerprofile_importer.py](utils/data_importers/playerprofile_importer.py)
**Purpose:** Main orchestrator for all PlayerProfiler imports

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Added Step 4: Import game log (between roster and team metrics)
- ‚úÖ Updated final summary to show game log import counts

**Data Flow:**
```
1. Play-by-play ‚Üí Context data
2. Custom reports ‚Üí QB/Kicker season stats
3. Roster ‚Üí Player IDs and names
4. Game log ‚Üí Game-level QB stats (NEW)
5. Team metrics ‚Üí Aggregated team performance
```

**Compatibility:** ‚úÖ GOOD - No breaking changes

---

### 3. `play_by_play_importer.py` ‚úÖ NO CHANGES NEEDED
**Location:** [utils/data_importers/play_by_play_importer.py](utils/data_importers/play_by_play_importer.py)
**Purpose:** Import play-level context data

**Evaluation:**
- Data Compatibility: ‚úÖ GOOD
- Functionality Impact: UNCHANGED
- Maintenance Burden: LOW
- Performance: GOOD

**Reasoning:**
- Play-by-play provides context (down, distance, pressure)
- Game log provides stats (TDs, attempts)
- Both tables serve different purposes - no redundancy

**No Changes Required** ‚úÖ

---

### 4. `custom_reports_importer.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW RECOMMENDED
**Location:** [utils/data_importers/custom_reports_importer.py](utils/data_importers/custom_reports_importer.py)
**Purpose:** Import season-level QB and kicker stats

**Potential Issue:**
- May have overlapping stats with `player_game_log` (e.g., season TD totals)
- Kicker stats: Still needed (not in game log)
- QB season stats: Could be derived from game log SUM()

**Recommendation:**
- **Keep for now** - provides season aggregates that are useful
- **Future:** Consider deprecating QB portion if game log proves sufficient
- **Priority:** LOW (not blocking anything)

---

## üßÆ Calculator Agents

### 1. `qb_td_calculator_v2.py` ‚úÖ UPDATED
**Location:** [utils/calculators/qb_td_calculator_v2.py](utils/calculators/qb_td_calculator_v2.py)
**Purpose:** Enhanced QB TD edge detection with advanced metrics

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced `_calculate_red_zone_td_rate()` to use `player_game_log`
- ‚úÖ Added lookback window (default: 4 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Added data quality checks (min 2 weeks, min 5 attempts)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging for debugging

**Before:**
```python
# Queried play_by_play.is_touchdown (always 0)
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN is_touchdown = 1 THEN 1 END)
FROM play_by_play
WHERE qb_name = ? AND red_zone_play = 1
```

**After:**
```python
# Queries player_game_log.passing_touchdowns (actual TDs)
SELECT SUM(passing_touchdowns), SUM(red_zone_passes)
FROM player_game_log
WHERE player_name = ? AND season = ? AND week >= ?
```

**Test Results:**
- Patrick Mahomes: 26.9% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Joe Burrow: 33.3% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Baker Mayfield: 66.7% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ
- Josh Allen: 53.3% RZ TD rate ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Red zone calculations now functional

---

### 2. `edge_calculator.py` ‚úÖ NO CHANGES NEEDED
**Location:** [utils/edge_calculator.py](utils/edge_calculator.py)
**Purpose:** Core edge detection engine (v1 calculator)

**Evaluation:**
- Uses v2 calculator as black box ‚úÖ
- No direct dependency on data tables ‚úÖ
- Performance: GOOD

**No Changes Required** ‚úÖ

---

### 3. `first_half_total_calculator.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW
**Location:** [utils/calculators/first_half_total_calculator.py](utils/calculators/first_half_total_calculator.py)
**Purpose:** First half total edge detection

**Evaluation Needed:**
- Does it use play-by-play for scoring data?
- Could it benefit from game log stats?

**Action:** DEFER - Not blocking v2 QB TD calculator

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Quality Agents

### 1. `data_quality_validator.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE RECOMMENDED
**Location:** [utils/data_quality_validator.py](utils/data_quality_validator.py)
**Purpose:** Automated data quality monitoring

**Recommended Changes:**
- Add `player_game_log` completeness checks
- Validate red_zone_passes > 0 for starting QBs
- Check TD counts match between game_log and play_by_play

**Priority:** MEDIUM (enhances monitoring)

**Sample Check:**
```python
def validate_game_log_completeness(season, week):
    """Ensure game log has data for all starting QBs"""
    # Check that all QBs in player_roster have game_log entries
    # Validate TD counts are realistic (0-6 per game)
    # Flag QBs with 0 red zone attempts (potential data issue)
```

---

### 2. `data_validator.py` ‚úÖ COMPATIBLE
**Location:** [utils/data_validator.py](utils/data_validator.py)
**Purpose:** General data validation

**Evaluation:**
- Should work with new tables ‚úÖ
- May need schema updates if it checks table structure

**Action:** TEST - Run validation to ensure compatibility

---

### 3. `scheduled_validator.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE RECOMMENDED
**Location:** [utils/scheduled_validator.py](utils/scheduled_validator.py)
**Purpose:** Scheduled daily health checks

**Recommended Changes:**
- Add game log import check to daily health monitoring
- Alert if game log data missing for current week

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## üìà Strategy & Aggregation Agents

### 1. `strategy_aggregator.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW
**Location:** [utils/strategy_aggregator.py](utils/strategy_aggregator.py)
**Purpose:** Aggregates multiple betting strategies

**Evaluation Needed:**
- Does it directly query play_by_play?
- Is it compatible with v2 calculator changes?

**Action:** DEFER - Test during edge generation

---

### 2. `probability_models.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW
**Location:** [utils/probability_models.py](utils/probability_models.py)
**Purpose:** Probability calculation models

**Evaluation Needed:**
- Does it use play-by-play for TD probabilities?
- Should it leverage game log for historical TD rates?

**Action:** DEFER - Analyze if v2 results differ from v1

---

## üÜï Recommended New Agents

### 1. **Unified Data Access Layer** (Future)
**Purpose:** Single interface for querying player stats

**Benefits:**
- Abstracts PBP vs Game Log
- Simplifies calculator development
- Easier to add new data sources

**Example:**
```python
class PlayerStatsService:
    def get_red_zone_td_rate(qb_name, weeks=4):
        """Automatically chooses game_log or derives from PBP"""
        # Uses game_log if available, falls back to PBP
```

**Priority:** LOW (nice-to-have, not critical)

---

### 2. **Data Quality Monitor** (Recommended)
**Purpose:** Automated post-import validation

**Benefits:**
- Catches `is_touchdown=0` type issues immediately
- Validates data freshness
- Alerts on anomalies

**Triggers:**
- Post-import hook
- Scheduled daily check

**Priority:** MEDIUM (prevents future data quality issues)

## üö® Risk Assessment

### Resolved ‚úÖ
- ~~v2 calculator blocked by is_touchdown=0~~ ‚Üí Fixed with game log
- ~~No touchdown data available~~ ‚Üí Game log provides real TDs
- ~~Red zone rates always 0.0~~ ‚Üí Now realistic (20-67%)

### Remaining Risks üî¥
1. **Data Synchronization** (MEDIUM)
   - Game log and play-by-play imported separately
   - Potential for mismatches if one import fails
   - **Mitigation:** Import both in same pipeline run (already implemented)

2. **Performance** (LOW)
   - Additional table queries for v2 calculator
   - **Mitigation:** Indexes added on (player_name, season, week)
   - **Monitor:** Query times in production

3. **Data Quality Regression** (LOW)
   - Future PlayerProfiler changes could break import
   - **Mitigation:** Historical snapshots + validation
   - **Monitor:** Daily health checks
